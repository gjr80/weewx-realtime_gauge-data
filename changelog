v0.4.0
*   updated to work under WeeWX v4.0 using either python 2 or 3
v0.3.7
*   revised WU API response parsing to eliminate occasional errors where no
    forecast text was found
v0.3.6
*   added support for new weather.com based WU API
*   removed support for old api.wunderground.com based WU API
*   updated to gauge-data.txt version 14 through addition of inTemp max/min and
    times fields (intempTH, intempTL, TintempTH and TintempTL)
*   minor reformatting of some RealtimeGaugeDataThread __init__ logging
*   reformatted up front comments in rtgd.py
*   changed the install instructions to restart rather than stopping then
    starting the WeeWX service
v0.3.5
*   added support for Darksky forecast API
*   added support for Zambretti forecast text (subject to weeWX forecasting
    extension being installed)
*   refactored code for obtaining scroller text
*   each scroller text source now uses its own 2nd level (ie [[ ]]) config with
    the scroller source specified under [RealtimeGaugeData]
v0.3.4 (not released)
*   added support for optional fields mrfall and yrfall
v0.3.3
*   implemented atomic write when writing gauge-data.txt to file
v0.3.2
*   modified rtdgthread queue management to fix 100% CPU usage issue
v0.3.1
*   added ignore_lost_contact config option to ignore the sensor contact
    check result
*   refactored lost contact flag check code, now uses a dedictaed method to
    determine whether sensor contact has been lost
*   changed a syslog entry to indicate 'rtgd' as the source not 'engine'
v0.3.0
*   added ability to include Weather Underground forecast text
v0.2.14
*   changed default decimal places for foot, inHg, km_per_hour and
    mile_per_hour
*   reformatted rtgd.py change summary
*   minor refactoring of RtgdBuffer class
v0.2.13
*   unnecessary whitespace removed from JSON output (issue #2)
*   JSON output now sorted alphabetically by key (issue #2)
*   revised debug logging (issue #7). Now supports debug=0,1,2 and 3:
    0 - standard weeWX output, no debug info
    1 - as per debug=0, advises whether Zambretti is available, logs minor
        non-fatal errors (eg posting)
    2 - as per debug=1, logs events that occur, eg packets queued, packets
        processed, output generated
    3 - as per debug=2, logs packet/record contents
*   gauge-data.txt destination directory tree is created if it does not exist
    (issue #8)
v0.2.12 (never released)
*   fixed empty sequence ValueError associated with BearingRangeFrom10 and
    BearingRangeTo10
*   fixed division by zero error when calculating windrun during first archive
    period of the day
v0.2.11
*   can now include local date/time in scroller text by including strftime()
    format directives in the scroller text
*   gauge-data.txt content can now be sent to a remote URL via HTTP POST.
    Thanks to Alec Bennett for his idea
v0.2.10
*   now supports reading scroller text from a text file specified by the
    scroller_text config option in [RealtimeGaugeData]
v0.2.9
*   reworked ten minute gust calculation to fix problem where red gust 'wedge'
    would occassionally temporarily disappear from wind speed gauge
v0.2.8
*   Reworked day max/min calculations to better handle missing historical data.
    If historical max/min data is missing day max/min will default to the
    current value for the obs concerned.
v0.2.7
*   loop packets are now cached to support partial loop packet stations
*   windSpeed obtained from archive is now only handled as a ValueTuple to
    avoid units issues
v0.2.6
*   updated docstring config options to reflect current library of available
    options
*   'latest' and 'avgbearing' wind directions now return the last non-None
    wind direction respectively when their feeder direction is None
*   implemented optional scroller_text config option allowing fixed scroller
    text to be specified in lieu of Zambretti forecast text
*   renamed rtgd thread and queue variables
*   no longer reads unit group config options that have only one possible unit
*   use of mmHg, knot or cm units reverts to hPa, mile_per_hour and mm
    respectively due to weeWX or SteelSeries Gauges not understanding the unit
    (or derived unit)
*   made gauge-data.txt unit code determination more robust
*   reworked code that formats gauge-data.txt field data to better handle None
    values
v0.2.5
*   fixed error where altitude units could not be changed from meter
*   rainrate and windrun unit groups are now derived from rain and speed units
    groups respectively
*   solar calc config options no longer searched for in [StdWXCalculate]
v0.2.4
*   fixed error where rain units could not be changed form mm
*   pressures now formats to correct number of decimal places
*   reworked temp and pressure trend formatting
v0.2.3
*   Fixed logic error in windrose calculations.
*   Minor tweaking of windrose processing.
v0.2.2
*   Added config option apptemp_binding specifying a binding containing appTemp
    data. apptempTL and apptempTH default to apptemp if binding not specified
    or it does not contain appTemp data.
*   added missing mile string format to installer
v0.2.1
*   fixed error that resulted in incorrect pressL and pressH values
v0.2
*   now runs in a thread to eliminate blocking impact on weewx
*   now calculates WindRoseData
*   now calculates pressL and pressH
*   frequency of generation is now specified by a single config option
    min_interval
*   gauge-data.txt output path is now specified by rtgd_path config option
*   added config options for windrose period and number of compass points to
    be generated

v0.1.2
*   fix error that occurred when stations do not emit radiation

v0.1.1
*   better handle loop observations that are None

v0.1
*   initial release
